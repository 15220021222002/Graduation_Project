# DCare.API – Graduation Project 🏥

**DCare** is a medical appointment management system built as a graduation project.  
This repository contains the **Back-End API only**, developed entirely by **Me** using ASP.NET Core Web API.

## 🎯 Project Overview

DCare serves 3 main user roles:

- **Patient**: register, log in, view doctors, book appointments, and pay online.
- **Doctor**: register, upload documents, set available time slots, and manage bookings.
- **Admin**: review and approve doctor requests, manage appointments, and track platform earnings.
